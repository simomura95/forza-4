# Forza 4
Connect 4 game (Forza 4 in italian), played in terminal as text.
2 players are needed as there is no AI.

Each turn, the player chooses a column to insert its sign, which will go to the first free slot starting from the bottom.
When four equal signs are detected along any direction (row, column or diagonal), that player wins.
